PIR SENSOR
**********

With the PIR Sensor attached, you can create an interactive installation which triggers a random video as soon as the sensor detects motion.

- This works with *.mp4 videos and/or *.mp3 audios.
- Copy the loop (default, standby) video to the media/internal/pir/loop folder
- Copy the trigger videos (can by any amount) to the media/internal/pir/trigger folder.
